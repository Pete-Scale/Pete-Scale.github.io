## Description

Took the Horiseon webpage and optimized it without changing its appearance or function.


---

## Features

- WHEN I view the source code

    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<br><br>
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<br><br>
- WHEN I view the image elements

    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
<br><br>
- WHEN I view the heading attributes

    THEN they fall in sequential order
<br><br>
- WHEN I view the title element

    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

___

## Usage

"Search Engine Optimization" navigation button now works correctly.

The site is not fully reactive, so when the screen size is changed the elements of the page don't maintain a nice format... 

but we didn't have to change that, and I'm tired :)
